# FFT_NASM_YoctoProject
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computational algorithm used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to modify, filter and decode digital audio, video and images. This is a student project that implement FFT algorithm using Language Assembler by Netwide Assembler (NASM) and some tools of Yocto Project, in order to create a Linux image.
