# NASM_FFT_YoctoProject
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computational algorithm used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to modify, filter and decode digital audio, video and images. This is a student project that implement FFT algorithm using Netwide Assembler (NASM) and some tools of Yocto Project to create a Linux image.
